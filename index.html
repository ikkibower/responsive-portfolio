				<h1>About Me</h1>
				
				<p class='aboutP'><img class='profile' src='images/profile.jpg'>
				Elliott Chalmers is an American businessman, inventor, and industrial designer. He was the co-founder, chairman, and chief executive officer (CEO) of Flava LLC.; CEO and majority shareholder of UNLTD, Inc; a member of Chalmers Enterprises board of directors following its acquisition of FlavaPC; and founder, chairman, and CEO of Tim's Atari Midi World. Chalmers is widely recognized as a pioneer of the microcomputer revolution of the 1970s and 1980s.

				I worked hard at keeping personal beliefs out of my work, but there were limits. My first job, in a deeply conservative Omaha newsroom, was a test. Most of my colleagues thought I was a crazed liberal for supporting Medicare and the voting rights and civil rights bills.
				<br>
				I am a monthly contributer to the on-line MyAtari magazine. Below you will find links to my past articles covering many applications. I tend to review programs that are not well known in order to bring them to the public's attention. It has been a rewarding experience.The actual programs are also downloadable as it is an on-line magizine. MyAtari are still looking for contributers. Check out the contributer page on the main site.
